abstract = "Ongoing collaborative work on the statistical mechanics of two-dimensional vesicles is reviewed with emphasis on the range of fractal and nonfractal shapes exhibited by the bead-and-tether model of a closed membrane which also embodies an osmotic pressure difference, Δp, and a bending rigidity modulus, κ; Monte Carlo simulations and scaling analyses are described. Flaccid vesicles, with Δp=κ=0, represent closed self-avoiding rings; their mean area, 〈A〉, scales with the mean square size, 〈RG2〉; their mean shape is close to elliptical. Inflated, Δp > 0 vesicles become circular; deflated, Δp<0 vesicles collapse to form branched polymers. The vesicle shapes appear to vary continuously with the scaling combination Δp N2ν, where N is the number of monomers/beads and ν=34. For Δp <0 and κKBT large relative to N3 a range of characteristic nonfractal shapes or cytotypes appears."

	abstract = {Topological insulators and their analogs in mechanical materials support conducting states only on their surface. We show that such topologically protected edge modes can also occur as the steady states of classical systems driven out of equilibrium. As proof of principle of the generic applicability of such notions, we show the existence of topologically localized states in a collection of interacting particles described by a hydrodynamic theory and discuss a general procedure to establish them in stochastic networks. In both cases, dissipative processes that break time-reversal symmetry are key to topological protection. Our results provide design principles for robust edge modes in synthetic systems as well as for the localization of flow of matter and information in biology.In this paper, we report that notions of topological protection can be applied to stationary configurations that are driven far from equilibrium by active, dissipative processes. We consider two physically disparate systems: stochastic networks governed by microscopic single-particle dynamics, and collections of driven interacting particles described by coarse-grained hydrodynamic theory. We derive our results by mapping to well-known electronic models and exploiting the resulting correspondence between a bulk topological number and the spectrum of dissipative modes localized at the boundary. For the Markov networks, we report a general procedure to uncover the topological properties in terms of the transition rates. For the active fluid on a substrate, we introduce a topological interpretation of fluid dissipative modes at the edge. In both cases, the presence of dissipative couplings to the environment that break time-reversal symmetry are crucial to ensuring topological protection. These examples constitute proof of principle that notions of topological protection do indeed extend to dissipative processes operating out of equilibrium. Such topologically robust boundary modes have implications for both biological and synthetic systems.},

@article{Avital2015,
abstract = {We use computer simulations and a simple free energy model to study the response of a bilayer membrane to the application of a negative (compressive) mechanical tension. Such a tension destabilizes the long wavelength undulation modes of giant vesicles, but it can be sustained when small membranes and vesicles are considered. Our negative tension simulation results reveal two regimes - (i) a weak negative tension regime characterized by stretching-dominated elasticity, and (ii) a strong negative tension regime featuring bending-dominated elastic behavior. This resembles the findings of the classic Evans and Rawicz micropipette aspiration experiment in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) [Phys, Rev. Lett. {\{}$\backslash$bf 64{\}}, 2094 (1990)]. However, while in GUVs the crossover between the two elasticity regimes occurs at a small positive surface tension, in smaller membranes it takes place at a moderate negative tension. Another interesting observation concerning the response of a small membrane to negative surface tension is related to the relationship between the mechanical and fluctuation tensions, which are equal to each other for non-negative values. When the tension decreases to negative values, the fluctuation tension {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} drops somewhat faster than {\$}\backslashtau{\$} in the small negative tension regime, before it saturates (and becomes larger than {\$}\backslashtau{\$}) for large negative tensions. The bending modulus exhibit an "opposite" trend. It remains almost unchanged in the stretching-dominated elastic regime, and decreases in the bending-dominated regime. Both the amplitudes of the thermal height undulations and the projected area variations diverge at the onset of mechanical instability.},

A curvature force, which models a fluctuating spontaneous curvature, and a permeation force coming from an active transport of fluid through the membrane. For the direct force and curvature force cases, we compare our results to existing experiments on active membranes.},

The crowding effect in particular has received considerable attention recently, in part because it is a colligative mechanism—implying that it could, in principle, be explored by any peripheral protein. Here we sought to clarify to what extent this mechanism is exploited by endocytic accessory proteins. We quantitatively investigate membrane curvature generation by means of a GUV shape stability assay. We found that the amount of crowding required to induce membrane curvature is correlated with membrane tension. Importantly, we also revealed that at the same membrane tension, the crowding mechanism requires far higher protein coverage to induce curvature changes compared to those observed for the endophilin BAR domain, serving here as an example of an endocytic accessory protein. Our results are important for the design of membrane-targeted biosensors as well as the understanding of mechanisms of biological membrane shaping.},

@article{Stachowiak2012,
abstract = {Curved membranes are an essential feature of dynamic cellular structures, including endocytic pits, filopodia protrusions and most organelles. It has been proposed that specialized proteins induce curvature by binding to membranes through two primary mechanisms: membrane scaffolding by curved proteins or complexes; and insertion of wedge-like amphipathic helices into the membrane. Recent computational studies have raised questions about the efficiency of the helix-insertion mechanism, predicting that proteins must cover nearly 100{\%} of the membrane surface to generate high curvature, an improbable physiological situation. Thus, at present, we lack a sufficient physical explanation of how protein attachment bends membranes efficiently. On the basis of studies of epsin1 and AP180, proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we propose a third general mechanism for bending fluid cellular membranes: protein-protein crowding. By correlating membrane tubulation with measurements of protein densities on membrane surfaces, we demonstrate that lateral pressure generated by collisions between bound proteins drives bending. Whether proteins attach by inserting a helix or by binding lipid heads with an engineered tag, protein coverage above {\~{}}20{\%} is sufficient to bend membranes. Consistent with this crowding mechanism, we find that even proteins unrelated to membrane curvature, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), can bend membranes when sufficiently concentrated. These findings demonstrate a highly efficient mechanism by which the crowded protein environment on the surface of cellular membranes can contribute to membrane shape change.},

@article{Murrell2012,
abstract = {Here we develop a minimal model of the cell actomyosin cortex by forming a quasi-2D cross-linked filamentous actin (F-actin) network adhered to a model cell membrane and contracted by myosin thick filaments. Myosin motors generate both compressive and tensile stresses on F-actin and consequently induce large bending fluctuations, which reduces their effective persistence length to {\textless}1 $\mu$m. Over a large range of conditions, we show the extent of network contraction corresponds exactly to the extent of individual F-actin shortening via buckling. This demonstrates an essential role of buckling in breaking the symmetry between tensile and compressive stresses to facilitate mesoscale network contraction of up to 80{\%} strain. Portions of buckled F-actin with a radius of curvature ∼300 nm are prone to severing and thus compressive stresses mechanically coordinate contractility with F-actin severing, the initial step of F-actin turnover. Finally, the F-actin curvature acquired by myosin-induced stresses can be further constrained by adhesion of the network to a membrane, accelerating filament severing but inhibiting the long-range transmission of the stresses necessary for network contractility. Thus, the extent of membrane adhesion can regulate the coupling between network contraction and F-actin severing. These data demonstrate the essential role of the nonlinear response of F-actin to compressive stresses in potentiating both myosin-mediated contractility and filament severing. This may serve as a general mechanism to mechanically coordinate contractility and cortical dynamics across diverse actomyosin assemblies in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells.},

There is an interplay between curvature-generating and curvature-sensing proteins during vesicle budding. This is seen during vesicle budding and in the formation of microenvironments.

But recent studies have suggested the involvement of non-equilibrium processes, without definitively ruling out equilibrium interpretations. Using active and passive microrheology to directly compare the membrane response and fluctuations on single erythrocytes, we report here a violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation, which is a direct demonstration of the non-equilibrium nature of flickering. With an analytical model of the composite erythrocyte membrane and realistic stochastic simulations, we show that several molecular mechanisms may explain the active fluctuations, and we predict their kinetics. We demonstrate that tangential metabolic activity in the network formed by spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein, can generate curvature-mediated active membrane motions. We also show that other active membrane processes represented by direct normal force dipoles may explain the observed membrane activity. Our findings provide solid experimental and theoretical frameworks for future investigations of the origin and function of active motion in cells.},

We use the results to rationalize the various structures of the intestinal lining observed $\backslash$emph{\{}in vivo{\}}. Taking into account the coupling between cell division and local curvature, we obtain different patterns of villi and crypts, which could explain the different morphologies of the small intestine and the colon.},

abstract = {We report numerical simulations of membrane tubulation driven by large colloidal particles. Using MonteCarlo simulations we study how the process depends on particle size and binding strength, and present accurate free energy calculations to sort out how tube formation compares with the competing budding process. We find that tube formation is a result of the collective behavior of the particles adhering on the surface, and it occurs for binding strengths that are smaller than those required for budding. We also find that long linear aggregates of particles forming on the membrane surface act as nucleation seeds for tubulation by lowering the free energy barrier associated to the process.},

abstract = {We present a microfluidic platform able to trap single GUVs in parallel. GUVs are used as model membranes across many fields of biophysics including lipid rafts, membrane fusion, and nanotubes. While their creation is relatively facile, handling and addressing single vesicles remains challenging. The PDMS microchip used herein contains 60 chambers, each with posts able to passively capture single GUVs without compromising their integrity. The design allows for circular valves to be lowered from the channel ceiling to isolate the vesicles from rest of the channel network. GUVs containing calcein were trapped and by rapidly opening the valves, the membrane pore protein $\alpha$-hemolysin ($\alpha$HL) was introduced to the membrane. Confocal microscopy revealed the kinetics of the small molecule efflux for different protein concentrations. This microfluidic approach greatly improves the number of experiments possible and can be applied to a wide range of biophysical applications.},

For finite systems of interacting particles, we review existing results showing that irreversible processes converge faster to their steady state than reversible ones. We show how this behaviour appears in the hydrodynamic limit of such processes, as described by macroscopic fluctuation theory, and we provide a quantitative expression for the acceleration of convergence in this setting. We give a geometrical interpretation of this acceleration, in terms of currents that are antisymmetric under time-reversal and orthogonal to the free energy gradient, which act to drive the system away from states where (reversible) gradient-descent dynamics result in slow convergence to equilibrium.",

  abstract = { Self-propelled particles include both self-phoretic synthetic colloids
	and various microorganisms. By continually consuming energy, they
	bypass the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics. These laws enforce
	the Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium: The steady state
	is then independent of kinetic parameters. In contrast, self-propelled
	particles tend to accumulate where they move more slowly. They may
	also slow down at high density for either biochemical or steric reasons.
	This creates positive feedback, which can lead to motility-induced
	phase separation (MIPS) between dense and dilute fluid phases. At
	leading order in gradients, a mapping relates variable-speed, self-propelled
	particles to passive particles with attractions. This deep link to
	equilibrium phase separation is confirmed by simulations but generally
	breaks down at higher order in gradients: New effects, with no equilibrium
	counterpart, then emerge. We give a selective overview of the fast-developing
	field of MIPS, focusing on theory and simulation but including a
	brief speculative survey of its experimental implications. },

	molecules are actively positioned either at the cell midpoint or

	are still poorly understood. Using computational modeling we propose
	a bimodal centering/segregation mechanism in bacteria which is driven
	by the dynamic instability of polymerizing filaments, which grow
	and shrink with regularity. Modeled cell centering via dynamically
	unstable filaments is confirmed experimentally via in vivo time-lapse,
	colocalization measurements of a model system of clustered plasmid-DNA
	centered by the dynamically unstable actin-like protein filaments
	Alp7A in Bacillus subtilis. Generalizing to any cylindrical cell,
	we find strong cell-length dependence in the centering ability of
	dynamically unstable filaments, culminating in pole positioning when
	cell length decreases significantly below the theoretically predicted
	average filament length. Modeling dynamic instability-driven positioning
	mechanisms from multiple anisotropic in vivo systems demonstrates
	that dynamically unstable filaments are a general mechanism for both
	midcell and cell-pole (segregation) positioning, and that desired
	positioning is preferentially selected in vivo by intrinsic filament
	polymerization rates and number.},

	cues. A simple example is the classic problem, first considered by
	Berg and Purcell, of determining the concentration of a chemical
	ligand in the surrounding media. On general theoretical grounds,
	it is expected that such computations require cells to consume energy.
	In particular, Landauer’s principle states that energy must be consumed
	in order to erase the memory of past observations. Here, we explicitly
	calculate the energetic cost of steady-state computation of ligand
	concentration for a simple two-component cellular network that implements
	a noisy version of the Berg–Purcell strategy. We show that learning
	about external concentrations necessitates the breaking of detailed
	balance and consumption of energy, with greater learning requiring
	more energy. Our calculations suggest that the energetic costs of
	cellular computation may be an important constraint on networks designed
	to function in resource poor environments, such as the spore germination

  abstract = {Length regulation of microtubules (MTs) is essential for many cellular
	processes. Molecular motors like kinesin-8, which move along MTs
	and also act as depolymerases, are known as key players in MT dynamics.
	However, the regulatory mechanisms of length control remain elusive.
	Here, we investigate a stochastic model accounting for the interplay
	between polymerization kinetics and motor-induced depolymerization.
	We determine the dependence of MT length and variance on rate constants
	and motor concentration. Moreover, our analyses reveal how collective
	phenomena lead to a well-defined MT length.},

	their robust functioning despite the presence of thermal fluctuations
	and other sources of disorder. Such robust functions include sensory
	adaptation, enhanced enzymatic specificity and maintenance of coherent
	oscillations. Elucidating the relation between energy consumption
	and organization remains an important and open question in non-equilibrium
	statistical mechanics. Here we report that steady states of systems
	with non-equilibrium fluxes can support topologically protected boundary
	modes that resemble similar modes in electronic and mechanical systems.
	Akin to their electronic and mechanical counterparts, topological-protected
	boundary steady states in non-equilibrium systems are robust and
	are largely insensitive to local perturbations. We argue that our
	work provides a framework for how biophysical systems can use non-equilibrium
	driving to achieve robust function.}

	various applications such as wave guiding, vibration isolation, or

	length by switching between growing and shrinking states in a process
	termed dynamic instability. It has been suggested that the dynamic
	properties of MTs are central to the organization of the eukaryotic
	intracellular space, and that they are involved in the control of
	cell morphology, but the actual mechanisms are not well understood.
	Here, we present a theoretical analysis in which we explore the possibility
	that a system of dynamic MTs and MT end-tracking molecular motors
	is providing specific positional information inside cells. We compute
	the MT length distribution for the case of MT-length-dependent switching
	between growing and shrinking states, and analyze the accumulation
	of molecular motors at the tips of growing MTs. Using these results,
	we show that a transport system consisting of dynamic MTs and associated
	motor proteins can deliver cargo proteins preferentially to specific
	positions within the cell. Comparing our results with experimental

  abstract = {The Escherichia coli flagellar motor senses the intracellular concentration
	of the response regulator CheY-P and responds by varying the bias
	between its counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) rotational
	states. The response is ultrasensitive with a large Hill coefficient
	(approximately 10). Recently, the detailed distribution functions
	of the CW and the CCW dwell times have been measured for different
	CW biases. Based on a general result on the properties of the dwell-time
	statistics for all equilibrium models, we show that the observed
	dwell-time statistics imply that the flagellar motor switch operates
	out of equilibrium, with energy dissipation. We propose a dissipative
	allosteric model that generates dwell-time statistics consistent
	with the experimental results. Our model reveals a general nonequilibrium
	mechanism for ultrasensitivity wherein the switch operates with a
	small energy expenditure to create high sensitivity. In contrast
	to the conventional equilibrium models, this mechanism does not require
	one to assume that CheY-P binds to the CCW and CW states with different
	affinities. The estimated energy consumption by the flagellar motor
	switch suggests that the transmembrane proton motive force, which
	drives the motor's rotation, may also power its switching. The existence
	of net transitional fluxes between microscopic states of the switch
	is predicted, measurement of these fluxes can test the nonequilibrium
	model directly. Both the results on the general properties of the
	dwell-time statistics and the mechanism for ultrasensitivity should
	be useful for understanding a diverse class of physical and biological
	systems.},

Dynamical phases are defined by typical trajectories executed by non-equilibrium systems in the space of internal states. We find that coexistence of dynamical phases can have dramatic consequences for function vs free energy cost trade-offs. Dynamical phases can also provide an intuitive picture of the design principles behind such biological Maxwell Demons.},

When z   <   z c   ≈  2 d , where d is the spatial dimension, frames are unstable with respect to internal deformations. This pedagogical review focuses on the properties of frames with z at or near z c , which model systems like randomly packed spheres near jamming and network glasses.

It shows how modifications to the periodic kagome lattice can eliminate all but trivial translational zero modes and create topologically distinct classes, analogous to those of topological insulators, with protected zero modes at free boundaries and at interfaces between different topological classes.},

Simple experiments we performed using prototypes of the chain vividly illustrate how the soft motion, initially localized at the edge, can in fact propagate unobstructed all of the way to the opposite end. Using real prototypes, simulations, and analytical models, we demonstrate that the chain is a mechanical conductor, whose carriers are nonlinear solitary waves, not captured within linear elasticity. Indeed, the linkage prototype can be regarded as the simplest example of a topological metamaterial whose protected mechanical excitations are solitons, moving domain walls between distinct topological mechanical phases. More practically, we have built a topologically protected mechanism that can perform basic tasks such as transporting a mechanical state from one location to another. Our work paves the way toward adopting the principle of topological robustness in the design of robots assembled from activated linkages as well as in the fabrication of complex molecular nanostructures.},

Many-body interactions and the multiple degrees of freedom available to charge carriers give electronic systems a range of exotic behaviors. S{\"u}sstrunk and Huber show that this extends to mechanical systems made up of a large lattice of coupled pendula. Mechanical excitations can be eliminated from the inner part of the lattice and confined to the edges, much like topological insulators. In addition to presenting a tractable toy system in which to study complex phenomena, the approach has potential uses in vibration isolation.Science, this issue p. 47A topological insulator, as originally proposed for electrons governed by quantum mechanics, is characterized by a dichotomy between the interior and the edge of a finite system: The bulk has an energy gap, and the edges sustain excitations traversing this gap. However, it has remained an open question whether the same physics can be observed for systems obeying Newton's equations of motion. We conducted experiments to characterize the collective behavior of mechanical oscillators exhibiting the phenomenology of the quantum spin Hall effect. The phononic edge modes are shown to be helical, and we demonstrate their topological protection via the stability of the edge states against imperfections. Our results may enable the design of topological acoustic metamaterials that can capitalize on the stability of the surface phonons as reliable wave guides.},
